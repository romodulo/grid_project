Dear Users,

I think I found the solution

Dear Users,

I apologize for not making my own bracket columns and
rows.

As some of you might know, 

I am only a jr. developer.

I tried conceptualizing the idea of coding my own
brackets, but i stumbled on a roadblock ...

It will take too much time to design one myself, 

So, I implemented what's available, which is why I
am implementing the challonge platform style
brackets. 

------
If you were able to conceptualize the bracket style
format in web design, I highly suggest you go
into the software development field.

You are talented.

If you would like to try to conceptualize this 
yourself, then you may try to design a bracket
look-a-like in excel, and if you are to do that, 
then the next time step would be to translate
it to html and css, and find a way to retrieve
data and display data on your excel look-a-like
of your look-a-like bracket. Then you're done.

Well, I decided it would take too much time, with
learning the basic strategies to build on from
concept, and there is already one made from
challonge, so I'm going to use Challonge's
platform.

Hope you enjoy!.
