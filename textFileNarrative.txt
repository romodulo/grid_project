Hello Everyone,

My name is Romel Elizaga

and I am going to explain
to you how to create a grid using css

with django

so far, the technologies

that i know is 

very little css

very little html

very little django

little python

zero javascript

and 

i am going to create a grid on css

using django, 

html

and python...

let's see how well this works out, shall we?

so the first step we're going to do is start a new project on python

I would normally use cmd

for now i will use git bash

i downloaded git bash and what i am going to do next is 

sorry I needed to restart my obs, so my file is definitely saved.

so back to the video

What I am Going To Do Is

open my command prompt, which in this case is my git bash,

I won't explain it in this video, but using git bash requires that I download a software called git, which I won't explain it here, but it is a very straight forward process

next I will create a user, which i forgot all the commands to already, oh well 

i know my username and email to log in my saves (which, git calls "commits") is already set up...

so i won't set up my username or email here.

whenever i make a commit, git bash will write the save ("commit") using my credentials, which i gave it in the beginning, which is my username and email..

actually, let's just write out my username and email again, because I will be showing you how to use github, and create a repository
